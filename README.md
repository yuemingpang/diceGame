# diceGame
* This is a simple dice rolling game in Java.
* The user will compete with the computer's RNG (random number generator).
* If the user rolls 2 through 6, the user can continue rolling until the user rolls 1 or the user can hold (the previous rolls will be added to the score).
* The computer follows the same rules but it will not stop until it rolls 1 or score more than 20 points in this round.
* Whoever scores more than 100 points wins.
